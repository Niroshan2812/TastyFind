## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed.
- **React Native CLI**: Ensure you have React Native CLI set up.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fridge-recipe-app.git
   cd fridge-recipe-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and add a web app to get the Firebase configuration object.
   - Replace the values in `firebaseConfig.js` with your Firebase project details.

   ```js
   const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "your-api-key",
      authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
      projectId: "your-project-id",
      storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
      messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
      appId: "your-app-id"
   };
   ```

4. Firebase Firestore setup:
   - In Firebase, create a Firestore database.
   - Add a collection called `fridgeItems` with fields like `name`, `quantity`, `expiration`, and auto-generated `id`.

5. Start the development server:
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     npm run android
     ```
   - For iOS:
     ```bash
     npm run ios
     ```

## Firebase Configuration

To set up Firebase with the app, ensure youâ€™ve installed Firebase SDK:

```bash
npm install firebase
```

In `firebaseConfig.js`, include your Firebase project configuration:

```js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

const firebaseConfig = {
   apiKey: "your-api-key",
   authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
   projectId: "your-project-id",
   storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
   messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
   appId: "your-app-id"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);

export { db };
```

2. Use the **Edit** button next to an item to modify its details (name, quantity, expiration).
3. Save the changes, and they will be stored in Firebase Firestore.
